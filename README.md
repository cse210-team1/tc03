David Bloomfield:
	I am from a small town in Colorado called Monument.  This is my 2nd semester at BYUI studying computer science as a major and english as a minor.  I feel programming comes naturally to me and I love how creative and analytical it is.  When I'm not doing homework or sitting in class I like to read, cook, play music, and studying unix.
	
TJ Putnam:
	I am from Aurora, Colorado. It is currently my 5th semester at BYUI, and I have recently switched my major
	from Electrical Engineering to Software Engineering. I've always enjoyed the behind-the-scenes aspect of
	programming, and I've been somewhat good at it. When not programming, I like to play games and read.
