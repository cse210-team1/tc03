David Bloomfield:
	I am from a small town in Colorado called Monument.  This is my 2nd semester at BYUI studying computer science as a major and english as a minor.  I feel programming comes naturally to me and I love how creative and analytical it is.  When I'm not doing homework or sitting in class I like to read, cook, play music, and studying unix.
